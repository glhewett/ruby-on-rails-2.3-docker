Yes, from time to time, I have to touch an ancient rails application.  The version of ruby and rails are long unmaintained.  I usually spend too much time trying to get an environment to do more development or testing on the application, so I hope that creating a docker image based on alpine is worth it.

There is still opportunity for improvement if one want to use this in a live environment.
